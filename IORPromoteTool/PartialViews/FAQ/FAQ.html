        What is the IOR Promotion Tool?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        The IOR Promotion Tool provides managers the opportunity to specify what is important, that might otherwise not get done because of items other people think are urgent, but are actually not as important.
        Once a request is promoted, it is elevated in the <a href="https://laserfiche.leankit.com/Boards/View/39048680">Infrastructure task board</a> 
        and will receive immediate attention as soon as resources are made available.

        Why can't I see the link on someone else's machine?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        The tool grabs the active directory credentials of the user currently logged into the windows session; so it is only possible to use the tool when a manager is logged in to the machine.

        How often can I promote a request?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        There is no limit to the number or frequency of promotions at this time. 
        Note that raising the priority of a request through promotion will effectively lower the priority of all other requests. 
        Please be considerate of others when promoting requests.
